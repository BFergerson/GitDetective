// This file defines a cross-reference service interface, based on Kythe data.
//
// Tickets are Kythe URIs (http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-uri-spec.html).

// XRefService provides fast read-only access to Kythe cross-reference
// relationships.  "Cross-references" generally include non-transitive
// (single-step) relations like usage of a declaration, instantiation of a
// type, invocation of a function, direct inheritance or overrides, and so
// forth.  Some transitive relations can be converted into cross-references by
// precomputing a flattened representation of a transitive relation.
//
// Key design principles:
//  - All requests must be satisfied "quickly", e.g., in time proportional to
//    the size of the returned set.
//
//  - The client should be able to batch related requests.
//
//  - The client specifies exactly what facts should be returned.
//

  // Decorations returns an index of the nodes and edges associated with a
  // particular file node.

  // nodes in the graph.

// GraphService provides fast single-step node and edge lookups in a Kythe
